I am currently a machine learning scientist at Tiktok US, focusing on building advanced deep recommendation systems.
Previously I obtained my Ph.D. Degree at Penn State University under the guidance of Prof. Fenglong Ma. My research experiences and interests lie in the field of health data mining and general deep learning, specifically utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and time series analysis to extract meaningful insights from large and complex data sets. My past projects have included the robustness of large language models, multi-modality model pre-training, text simplification, document retrieval, adverse event prediction, text classification, object detection and recognition, and cross-modality retrieval. These projects involved the development of innovative deep learning algorithms and models to extract relevant information from large and complex data sets and gave me broad experience in handling different modality data.
