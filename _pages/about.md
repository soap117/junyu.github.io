I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student at Penn State University and intend to graduate around 2024. My research experiences and interests lie in the field of health data mining and general deep learning, specifically utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and time series analysis to extract meaningful insights from large and complex data sets. My past projects have included the robustness of large language models, multi-modality model pre-training, text simplification, document retrieval, adverse event prediction, text classification, object detection and recognition, and cross-modality retrieval. These projects involved the development of innovative deep learning algorithms and models to extract relevant information from large and complex data sets and gave me broad experience in handling different modality data.
